### How did I broke down the solution

1. First I planned how commit message would be
2. This drove me into breaking the application in small pieces (components)
3. Redux is used for state management
4. Imlementing from parent component to child(s)
5. Building an API layer over.

#### Used 3rd parties

- [redux, react-redux](https://redux.js.org/) - App state management
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Handles API calls
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - middleware for async calls
- [semantic ui](react.semantic-ui.com) - used to for css library
